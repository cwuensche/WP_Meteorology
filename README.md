# WP_Meteorology
There's no real work done here yet, it's just getting started!

Imagine a Plugin that can help a meteorologist manage downloading all of the latest datasets for meteorology files (like Grib, grib2 files, and others). I will be creating tools to check the status of what the largest and most popular weather models are doing.

For example, some websites like tropicaltidbits download and display in real time the latest forecast for the 00Z, 06Z, 12Z and 18Z model runs. I will help you see what hour and run each model (CFS, GFS, CMC and ECMWF) is at.
